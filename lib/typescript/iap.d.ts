Just a few things to keep in mind:

- You can get your products in `componentDidMount`, `useEffect` or another appropriate area of your app.
- Since a user may start your app with a bad or no internet connection, preparing/getting the items more than once may be a good idea.
- If the user has no IAPs available when the app starts first, you may want to check again when the user enters your IAP store.

## Restoring purchases

You can use `getAvailablePurchases()` to do what's commonly understood as "restoring" purchases.

:::note
For debugging you may want to consume all items, you have then to iterate over the purchases returned by `getAvailablePurchases()`.
:::

:::warning
Beware that if you consume an item without having recorded the purchase in your database the user may have paid for something without getting it delivered and you will have no way to recover the receipt to validate and restore their purchase.
:::

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {Button} from 'react-native';
import {getAvailablePurchases,finishTransaction} from 'react-native-iap';

const App = () => {
  handleRestore = async () => {
    try {
      const purchases = await getAvailablePurchases();
      const newState = {premium: false, ads: true};
      let titles = [];

      await Promise.all(purchases.map(async purchase => {
        switch (purchase.productId) {
          case 'com.example.premium':
            newState.premium = true;
            titles.push('Premium Version');
            break;

          case 'com.example.no_ads':
            newState.ads = false;

            break;

          case 'com.example.coins100':
            await finishTransaction(purchase.purchaseToken);
            CoinStore.addCoins(100);
